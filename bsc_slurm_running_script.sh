# This is a batch script for running Toil as a serial job, which will then submit
# further batch jobs for the compute work.

# Before submitting this script, make sure that you have loaded the required modules
# and that the following environment variables set and exported.
#
# TMPDIR - this needs to be on a shared disk accessible by all compute nodes
# TOIL_SLURM_ARGS - these will be slurm settings used for compute jobs, for example:
# export TOIL_SLURM_ARGS="--time=12:0:0 --qos=prace --export=ALL"
export TOIL_SLURM_ARGS="--time=0:30:0 --qos=debug --export=ALL"
# 
#
# The required modules (for Mare Nostrum) are:
# module load ANACONDA/2019.10
# module load gcc
# module load nodejs
# module load singularity/3.5.2
#
# Toil should be loaded from a conda environment. It is expected that the BioBB tools, and 
# GROMACS executables, will be provided via docker containers (loaded via singularity).
# If this isn't the case then these should be loaded either from the modules, or via
# the conda environment.

# Flags for running slurm and Toil. Note that the defaultCores sets the usage for the jobs,
# which should fit within the nodes selected information in TOIL_SLURM_ARGS.
SLURM_FLAGS="--dont_allocate_mem --batchSystem slurm --defaultCores 6"

# Flags for general Toil usage - on HPC we generally need to disable caching and use singularity.
# Create the workdir directory beforehand.
TOIL_FLAGS="--workDir ./workdir --disableCaching --singularity --disableProgress"

# Flags for gathering data for stats analysis (these are stored in the cache directory)
# Create the jobstore base directory beforehand, and adapt the naming convention for the
# individual jobstore directories as you need.
