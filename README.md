# BioExcel Building Blocks (BioBB) High Performance Computing (HPC) Common Workflow Language (CWL) repository: md\_list workflow

This repository is part of a series of repositories mirroring the workflow and launchers in [https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_hpc_workflows](https://github.com/bioexcel/biobb_hpc_workflows).

Below the workflow is briefly described, followed by installation instructions, and guidance on running the workflow with the two workflow engines it has been tested on (CWLtool and TOIL).

## md\_list / md\_launch

The `md_list` workflow performs a molecular dynamics simulation on a given structure listed in the YAML properties file.

The `md_launch` workflow will run the `md_list` workflow multiple times (using scatter), passing it structures from a list defined in the YAML properties file.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

* [CWLtool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) or [Toil](https://toil.ucsc-cgl.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Singularity](https://sylabs.io/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)

If you are working on your own machine then instructions for installing **Git** and **Docker** are given on their websites. You will be able to use either CWLtool (which is the reference implementation of CWL) or toil.

If you are working on HPC then you will need **Singularity** and **Toil** rather than Docker and CWLtool. Git and Singularity should already be installed, while the installation of Toil (if this is not installed already) will be covered below.

Version requirements:
* The workflow engine should support CWL standard 1.2 or more recent (versions tested: 1.2.0-dev5 in toil; 1.2 in CWLtool)

### Setup

These workflows make use of the BioBB libraries, which are installed using `git submodules`. This requires that you clone this repository, rather than downloading a zip archive (as the git hooks are needed for this to work):
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/douglowe/biobb_hpc_cwl_md_list.git
```

#### CWLtool

This can be installed via `conda`, with the command:
```
conda env create -f install/env_cwlrunner.yml
```
To install a javascript interpreter (if you do not already have one on your system) use:
```
conda env create -f install/env_cwlrunner_nodejs.yml
```


#### TOIL

This can be installed using `conda`, with the command:
```
conda env create -f install/env_toil.yml
```
To install a javascript interpreter (if you do not already have one on your system) use:
```
conda env create -f install/env_toil_nodejs.yml
```


### Running the Workflows

This workflow requires:
1. PDB file describing the molecule of interest (see example `example_input_files/lysozyme.pdb`).
2. Configuration file (see example `md_list_input_descriptions.yml`).

#### CWL

To run the workflow use:
```
cwl-runner md_launch.cwl md_list_input_descriptions.yml
```

#### TOIL

TOIL (at the time of writing, version 5.2.0) does not yet fully support the CWL v1.2.0
standard, so you will need to edit `md_list.cwl` to use: `cwlVersion: v1.2.0-dev5`. 

To use the toil engine several environmental variables will need to be set. These will be 
described in more detail on the TOIL documentation page, below we only highlight the 
variables we found useful to set.

On all HPC systems it is wise to check the temporary directory variable (`TMPDIR`) - for 
TOIL this needs to be on a disk accessible by all compute nodes that will be used. 

For Singularity set the variables `CWL_SINGULARITY_CACHE` and `SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` 
(again on a disk accessible by all compute nodes).

##### GridEngine (SGE)

For SGE set:
1. `TOIL_GRIDENGINE_PE` (this is the job queue to select)
2. `TOIL_GRIDENGINE_ARGS`

To execute the workflow use:
```
toil-cwl-runner --enable-dev --batchSystem grid_engine --singularity --defaultCores 1 md_launch.cwl md_list_input_descriptions.yml
```
This example sets the number of cores used to 1 - we recommend you test your setup
as a serial job before trying to use parallel compute nodes. When changing to a parallel compute job change the `--defaultCores` flag.

##### SLURM

For Slurm job managers set:
1. `TOIL_SLURM_ARGS`, this carries all the required slurm job flags, e.g. `"--nodes=1 --ntasks-per-node=64 --time=0:10:0 --partition=standard --qos=standard --account=[XXX] --export=ALL"`

To execute the workflow use:
```
toil-cwl-runner --enable-dev --batchSystem slurm --singularity md_launch.cwl md_list_input_descriptions.yml
```
